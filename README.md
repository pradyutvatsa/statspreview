## My process

1. As it was my first independent project and had only done code alongs prior, this was challenging to say the least. Where to begin, how to think about mobile responsive development. All of this was new to me. 
2. Once I got a hang of alignment of columns and content I was able to quickly build a structure and check it at the various edge cases for e.g. small, medium breakpoints. 

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS 
- Flexbox
- Bootstrap 5.0

### What I learned

Things that I learned the most in this exercise - 

- How to use flex utilities in BS framework 
- How to think as a developer building a simple static asset that's responsive across mobile and web
- Thinking of relative font sizes and viewport properties such as height and width
- Learnt a new element in html - the <picture> element 
- Also understood the nuance between horizontal centering of items Vs. vertical centering of items


### Continued development

I'm going to take on a few more HTML and CSS only projects on frontendmentor as I really enjoyed this one. Further, I will continue my learnings of web development using Colt's course and dive into the brand new world of JS. 


### Useful resources

- MDN resource for HTML
- Bootstrap get started website 
- W3C org for more bootstrap try outs
